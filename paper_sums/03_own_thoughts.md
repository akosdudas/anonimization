My original goal was to minimize the information content of a table while preserving its usefulness to a specific predefined research. While reading through these articles I realized that the main use in anonymization is for releasing data for public use, in which case there is no 2nd party to specify the requirements of the research. In cases when there is a research with well defined requirements, giving table schema information and controlled query access to the researchers seems to be the best way to go, as a formal query exactly specifies which part of the information blob is accessed. There is no use in reducing the information content of a table to the point where only the required information can be deduced from the released table, instead of giving the required information to the researchers.
In cases when the information is released to the public with unknown future research requirements, choosing an appropriate t-closeness and maximizing k-anonymity looks like the best way to protect privacy while maintaining usefulness of the data.Â 

next step: looking at the thesis and the anonymizer script of Jonis, Peter.
