# Ninghui Li, Tiancheng Li: t-Closeness: Privacy Beyond k-Anonymity and l-Diversity
The article begins by describing k-anonymity and l-diversity and their weaknesses. It makes a clear distinction between identity and attribute disclosure and demonstrates that k-anonymity only protects against identity disclosure, and while l-diversity aims to protect against attribute disclosure as well, it fails to do so under certain conditions. The article introduces a new way of measuring anonymity on top of k-anonymity: t-closeness. T-closeness requires that every equivalence class (tuples with the same quasi-identifier values) have approximately the same (within t EMD threshold) distribution of a sensitive attribute as the whole table. Its goal is to minimize the distance between the hypothetical ideally generalized table and the released, anonymized table. It also suggests that improving t-closeness, while protecting privacy, limits the usefulness of the data set, so one needs to choose a compromise between privacy and information content, but t-closeness defines a measurable way of doing so.
